# Lines starting with - need to be done, +, are done, ~ partial

- there is a need for errno/perror system
+ use elf as executable format, and not flat binary
- vfs should be rewrite, support for mount / register devices
  - cofs_cache should be moved to vfs, and not implemented in file system
  - a better dev should be written
- console should be clean-up; not really used after switching to tty.
- tty should implement timeout for raw mode / some alarm or something,
  to wakeup process that reads in raw mode, if for eg. 1 second passed and
  no character was received - tty_read(), tty.c. Do processes should
  sleep if they are in tty raw mode and queue is empty?
  Maybe a sleep(x seconds) will solve the problem.
  How to test - press esc in kilo
- crt should be able to respond when asked for cursor position
- crt should handle save cursor/restore cursor
- tty.c should ask remote terminal for it's winsize, or set to 0, or is the
  getty job to set the line? (better)
- problem with truncate, when truncate len > sizeof file
- switch between console/getty
- validate syscalls pointers
- cosh should support jobs
- add/fix mount; remove inode functions and use a vtable fs_node->iop->open.
- fix hdd to use interrupts and a queue of buffers
- libc
    - add fdopen to libc
    + write a clean vsnprintf function and rewrite vsprintf to use it
        + move all *printf to use "n", safe version
    - make vsnprintf work OK on 64 bits - need a clean div/mod for 64 bits, or
      use gcc __umoddi3/__udivdi3 or rewrite them
    - printf should be buffered - use fprintf
    + write a sscanf function - vsscanf, no floating point support yet.
    - ntoh* hton* should check host endianness and do nothing on big endian 
       platforms.
